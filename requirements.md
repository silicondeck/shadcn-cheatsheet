**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 2, 2025

## Core Vision

Transform how developers discover, learn, and implement shadcn/ui components through an intuitive, fast, and visually stunning interface that serves as the definitive shadcn/ui reference.

## Functional Requirements (EARS Notation)

**WHEN** the viewport is 640px or larger, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display components in 2 columns.

**WHEN** the viewport is 768px or larger, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display components in 3 columns.

**WHEN** the viewport is 1024px or larger, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display components in 4 columns.

**WHEN** components have varying heights, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use masonry layout to optimize space usage.

### FR-004: Component Cards

**WHEN** a component card is displayed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** show title, install command, documentation link, variants, import statement, and usage code.

**WHEN** a user clicks the install command, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** copy the command to clipboard and show success feedback.

**WHEN** a user clicks the documentation link, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** open official shadcn/ui documentation in a new tab.

**WHEN** a user clicks copy import, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** copy the import statement to clipboard.

**WHEN** a user clicks copy usage, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** copy the usage code to clipboard.

### FR-005: Interactive Preview Panel

**WHEN** a user clicks on a component variant, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** open a slide-out panel from the right with 300ms animation.

**WHEN** the preview panel is open, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display live component preview at the top and editable code at the bottom.

**WHEN** a user edits code in the panel, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** update the preview in real-time.

**WHEN** a user clicks outside the panel or presses Escape, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** close the panel.

**WHEN** a user clicks the "Next" button in the preview panel, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** navigate to the next variant of the current component if available, otherwise move to the first variant of the next component.

**WHEN** a user clicks the "Previous" button in the preview panel, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** navigate to the previous variant of the current component if available, otherwise move to the last variant of the previous component.

**WHEN** there are no variants for a component, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display the default component example and navigate to the next/previous component accordingly.

### FR-006: Package Manager Selection

**WHEN** a user selects a package manager (pnpm, npm, yarn, bun), **THE SYSTEM SHALL** update all install commands throughout the application.

**WHEN** the application loads, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** default to pnpm as the package manager.

**WHEN** a user changes the package manager preference, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** persist this preference in localStorage and restore it on subsequent visits.

### FR-007: View Controls

**WHEN** a user clicks "Expand All", **THE SYSTEM SHALL** expand all component cards simultaneously to show all variants.

**WHEN** a user clicks "Collapse All", **THE SYSTEM SHALL** collapse all component cards simultaneously to show minimal view.

**WHEN** a user changes view preferences, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** persist this preference and maintain state across component navigation.

### FR-008: User Preferences Persistence

**WHEN** a user modifies any preference (package manager, theme, view mode), **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically save the preference to localStorage.

**WHEN** the application loads, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** restore all saved user preferences and apply them immediately.

**WHEN** localStorage is unavailable, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** gracefully fallback to default preferences without errors.

### FR-009: Footer Content

**WHEN** the footer is displayed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** show organized links in 4 columns with newsletter signup.

**WHEN** the footer is displayed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** show creator attribution with link to shadcnstore.com.

## Performance Requirements

### PR-001: Page Load Performance

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** achieve Lighthouse Performance score greater than 95.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** achieve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) less than 1.2 seconds.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** achieve First Input Delay (FID) less than 100 milliseconds.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** achieve Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) less than 0.1.

### PR-002: Interaction Performance

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** respond to user interactions within 200 milliseconds.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** complete panel slide animations within 300 milliseconds.

## Accessibility Requirements

### AR-001: WCAG Compliance

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** achieve Lighthouse Accessibility score of 100.

### AR-002: Keyboard Navigation

**WHEN** a user navigates using keyboard only, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide accessible focus indicators and logical tab order.

**WHEN** a user uses screen reader, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure.

## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: Framework and Libraries

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** use Next.js 15+ with App Router for optimal SEO.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** use Tailwind CSS 4.x with shadcn/ui v3 for styling.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** use Lucide React for consistent iconography.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** implement static site generation (SSG) for maximum performance.

### TR-002: SEO Optimization

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** implement meta tag optimization for shadcn/ui searches.

### CR-002: Code Examples

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide import statements for each component.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide usage examples for each component variant.

**THE SYSTEM SHALL** implement syntax highlighting with line numbers.

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### EC-001: Network Issues

**IF** the user has slow network connection, **THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL** implement progressive loading with skeleton states.

**IF** external documentation links fail, **THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide fallback error messages.

**WHEN** the preview panel opens on mobile, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** adjust panel width to maintain usability.

## Confidence Assessment

**Confidence Score: 88%**

**Rationale:**

- High clarity of requirements from detailed specification document
- Well-defined technical stack with proven technologies
- Clear reference point (Bootstrap cheatsheet) for UX patterns
- Comprehensive functional specifications provided
- Minor uncertainties around specific shadcn/ui component API details and exact animation implementation

**Risk Areas:**

- shadcn/ui component API changes requiring updates
- Performance optimization for large component datasets
- Mobile UX optimization for slide-out panels
- Real-time code editing implementation complexity
